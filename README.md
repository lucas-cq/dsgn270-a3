## User Story :
#### Skateboard Magazine
* As a skateboard magazine company I would like to show a skater of the day on my website, to display skaters for possible sponsorships.

* This integration would first save clients from asking me to update their page everytime they post. Skating is also a slowly dying industry, but if more people see the value in it (Like a new skateboard magazine) they will more likely sponsor new skaters. Skaters will also be incouraged to post their stunts, to hopefully get featured on the page.

## Task Flow
1. Log into your business profile
2. Find a skater you would like to award skater of the day
3. Make a new post with the hashtag : #skateroftheday
4. Double check site output is working correctly
5. Success!
